# CSS-Playground

I have found that I learn best when I take a problem and distill it down to its
most essential parts, and work on that part independently of any context.

For example, if I want to learn what the `align-items` CSS property does, I can
start with a blank slate, hold everything else constant, and experiment only
with the `align-items` property. By starting with a blank slate, I have
confidence that the behavior I am witnessing is solely due to the `align-items`
property, and not some unknown context that is also impacting behavior.
